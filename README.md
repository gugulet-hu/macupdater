Package management on macOS is a challenge. This is my amateurish attempt to combine all my package updates into one app. This app updates brew, brew cask apps, apm packages, ruby gems, rvm, npm packages and macOS \(including system software\) Apps. Note: the app only runs in admin account as it needs admin privileges.

## Packages supported

* [Brew](https://brew.sh/)
* [Brew Casks](https://github.com/buo/homebrew-cask-upgrade)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
